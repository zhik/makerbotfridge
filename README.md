$ the light snack stopper

The problem: the fridge door constantly opening. whether getting a snack, little kids and/or pets messing with it, Or even that pesky moocher friend you have getting to your good drinks. 

The solution: the light snack stopper. A locking system that uses mini- games to have you unlock it.

The 3d printer was a big help in both the casing for the device as well as major components such such as the locking hook 

The mini-game is a Simon-sez-like system where a series of lights, indicating a directional commands are needed to unlock the fridge. The code was made so that every time the door closes and re-locks, the command is randomized, so it's never the same twice. 

This helps with people who are dieting. It adds another barrier that keeps the dieter from cheating further, that extra moment in time can be enough to have said person think twice about breaking. 

And diet aid isn't the only application. Say you have someone who is a heavy drinker, every time they want more, they have to enter the code. Inebriation can alter motor skills, making it harder to follow the code than say someone who doesn't drink. 

Safety can be another factor when using this device. Little kids who constant pay with the fridge door or just gets something they shouldn't, will have to work the mini-game (if they could reach it) 

And pets who can force the door open (having a dog that could do that, I speak from experience) won't be able too with the lock in place

In conclusion, the light-snack stopper is an ideal edition to the GE smart fridge for the needs of dieters, heavy drinkers and starting families
